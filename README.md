# CROSS
Consensus-Ranking Organizational-Support System

This application is inspired by the original CROSS developed by Madjid Tavana. The original CROSS was an Excel implementation used as a multicriteria group-decision-making model by utilizing AHP, analytic hierarchy process, in conjunction with other methods in order to enhance the decision makers' intuition in evaluating sets of projects at NASA.
